# Primox: implementing Lox in Result (WIP)

This project creates a programming language, following the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), but in Rust instead of Java.

So far the language has:
- Numbers, booleans, and strings
- Print and expression statements
- Arithmetic and logical expression

Everything lies in the "src" folder, including:
- "scanner.rs": scanner and lexer
- "ast_printer.rs": print out the abstract syntax tree
- "parser.rs": recursive descent parser
- "interpreter.rs": evaluate the program
